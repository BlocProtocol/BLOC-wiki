# **Using BLOCWallet Cli**

The **CLI Wallet**, called **BLOCWallet**, is a multi-platform program (Win/Linux/Mac) that requires you to enter commands for it to work and you cannot use your mouse. It is text only application that does not have a graphical interface.

However, it is currently the **most stable** and **gets the newest updates first**.

Here's a quick image of [BLOCWallet](https://bloc.money/download)

![blocwallet](images/BlocWallet/BLOCWallet_v3.0.0.png)

## **Downloading**

* Binary distributions can be found: [GitHub](https://github.com/furiousteam/BLOC/releases/latest).
* Also available on our [Website](https://bloc.money/download).
* Select the appropriate file for the target platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).
* Binaries are provided in `.zip` format, while source code is provided in `.zip` and `.tar.gz` format.

## **Installing**

### Installing on Windows

Extract the *.zip* file (`BLOC-...-windows.zip`).

### Installing on Mac

Extract the *.zip* file:

```bash
unzip BLOC-...-mac.zip
```

### Installing on Linux

Extract the *.zip* file:

```bash
unzip BLOC-...-linux.zip
```

## **Synchronizing the Blockchain**

Here's a quick image of `BLOCd MAIN NET` in action:

![BLOCd MAIN NET](images/BLOCd/BLOC-MAINNET-3.0.0.1.png)

Here's a quick image of `BLOCd TEST NET` in action:

![BLOCd TEST NET](images/BLOCd/BLOC-TESTNET-3.0.0.1.jpg)

Running `BLOCd` will start the *BLOCd* network daemon, which will connect to the network and begin downloading and verifying the BLOC blockchain.  

Because the blockchain is constantly growing, the file size always increases (the blockchain is currently over 2 GB), and *BLOCd must verify every block*, which is both CPU and disk intensive. An SSD with at least this much free disk space is recommended, unless you plan to use [remote nodes](../Using-remote-nodes). 

## **Using Checkpoints**

You can sync a fresh chain from block 0 much quicker by using checkpoints. Follow [this guide](../Using-checkpoints-for-BLOCd.md) to learn more.

### Windows

Run the `BLOCd.exe` executable extracted from the Windows binary zip:

### Mac / Linux

Run the `BLOCd` binary extracted from the `.zip` download:

```bash
./BLOCd
```

## **Using BLOCWallet**

With `BLOCd` still running in the background or another terminal/shell/command prompt, open BLOCWallet:

### Windows

Run the `BLOCWallet.exe` executable from the extracted folder.

### Mac / Linux

```bash
./BLOCWallet
```

## **Using BLOCWallet commands**

**BLOCWallet has a twin command system**; a *numerical shortcut* for navigating the menu, and *typed commands* you can access directly. The more you use BLOCWallet the more typed commands you'll pick up. This guide is written using the written commnand system. Feel free to use the numbers associated with the command.

## **Create** a Wallet

Create your personnal BLOC Wallet address with Private spend key, Private view key andÂ Mnemonic seed. Everything you need to control your money.
Make sure you save this data because if you lose these keys your wallet cannot be recreated!

[BLOC JENNY]: 
```

## **backup** your wallet private keys

Each BLOC wallet is essentially, just a pair of keys (*View Key* and *Spend Key*) from which the public address is derived.
It is **very** important to export these keys and back them up somewhere that is safe and secure (meaning somewhere reliable/permanent that no one else can access).

In the event of a lost or corrupted wallet file, computer crash, etc., the *View Key* and *Spend Key* are the only way to restore a wallet and recover the funds it holds.

Here's a quick image of BLOCWallet in action after using the `backup` command:

![blocwallet](images/BlocWallet/BLOCWallet_v3.0.0_open_wallet_backup.png)

**DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE**. **Anyone who has these can *access your funds* and has *complete control* over your wallet.**

To print your keys; at the menu type `backup` or `4`and press `enter`.
The *View Key* , *Spend Key* and *Mnemonic Seed*  will appear. Copy them and store them `safely and securely`.

```
[BLOC JENNY]: backup

### 25 Word Mnemonic Seed phrase not showing ?!

![blocwallet](images/BlocWallet/backup-old.png)

* You may wonder why you do not see the new 25 Word Mnemonic Seed phrase while typing `backup` your wallet ?
* The 25 Word Mnemonic Seed phrase was implemented after you created this wallet. This is why you do not see the 25 Word Mnemonic seed.
* You will need to create a new wallet to be able to use the 25 Word Mnemonic seed and send your BLOC to your new wallet

## Viewing Wallet **balance**

* Available balance is the funds that are available for transactions.
* Locked amount shows the funds that are not yet available (unconfirmed transactions, the coins you've mined, time-locked transaction)
* Total

Here's a quick image of BLOCWallet in action after using the `balance` command:

![blocwallet](images/BlocWallet/BLOCWallet_v3.0.0_open_wallet_balance.png)

To view your wallet's balance; at the menu, type `balance` or `3` and press `enter`:

```
[BLOC JENNY]: balance
Available balance: 1.0000 BLOC
Locked (unconfirmed) balance: 0.0000 BLOC
Total balance: 1.0000 BLOC
[BLOC JENNY]:
```

##  **transfer** BLOC to someone<a name="tx-bloc"></a>

Send funds from your wallet to your friends, family or for business.

Here's a quick image of BLOCWallet in action after using the `transfer` command:

![blocwallet](images/BlocWallet/BLOCWallet_v3.0.0_open_wallet_transfer.png)

To send BLOC at the BLOCWallet menu:

- Type: `transfer` or `7` and press `enter`
- Type/paste the address you want to send the BLOC to and press `enter`
- Type the amount of BLOC you want to send (like `0.5`) and press `enter`
- Press `enter` to use the default fee of 0.0001 BLOC (or set it higher if you're sending a large amount of BLOC)
- Enter the payment ID if the recipient has provided one. Check the [payment ID section](#tx-bloc-p-id) if you're not sure when/how to use it
- If you make a mistake or need to stop the transaction, type `cancel` at any time
- Confirm that the details are correct and enter `y`. If something is amiss, enter `n` and follow the steps again
- Enter your password

Depending on the amount you transfer, you may need to wait a while for confirmation.  If you have had too many small incoming transactions, or the amount you wish to send is too large; either break up your transfer into several smaller amounts, or optimise your wallet.

## **optimize** your Wallet

* Optimizing your wallet consists to create Fusion transactions.
* Fusion transactions take all your (small) incoming payments and combine them into bigger ones, allowing you to send huge sums at once! It is strongly recommended to optimize your wallet, specially if you are mining BLOC and receiving a lot of small transactions.

Here's a quick image of BLOCWallet in action after using the `optimize` command:

![blocwallet](images/BlocWallet/BLOCWallet_v3.0.0_open_wallet_optimize.png)

To optimize your wallet, type `optimize` and press `enter`:
```
[BLOC JENNY]: optimize
Attempting to optimize your wallet to allow you to send large amounts at once. 
This may take a very long time!
Do you want to proceed? (Y/n): y
Running optimization round 1...
Full optimization completed!
[BLOC JENNY]: 
```

When it is completed, it will print out a green message `Full optimization completed!`

## **Payment ID**<a name="tx-bloc-p-id"></a>

Because transactions on the BLOC blockchain are privatized, in some situations a payment ID is necessary for the recipient to be able to determine where the payment came from, for instance when depositing to an exchange or other service.

**You need it if you're sending BLOC to an exchange**

Here's a quick image of BLOCWallet in action after using the payment id option while sending a transaction:

![blocwallet](images/BlocWallet/BLOCWallet_v3.0.0_open_wallet_payement-id.png)

To send a transaction with a payment ID, enter it when prompted to.

Note that typically, the service/recipient will generate and provide the required payment ID.
```
[BLOC JENNY]: transfer
Note: You can type cancel at any time to cancel the transaction

What address do you want to transfer to?: abLoc7qZYJd7cWysPQRivNNMQMFgkXNPgiQXN1i2twdUWvwr2XMbxsAbwdL3eJjCMSgs8oWyGx7pHCX8jWHrKi8Meap3gc5TujM

How much BLOC do you want to send?: 0.1

What fee do you want to use?
Hit enter for the default fee of 0.0001 BLOC:

```

## **exit** the Wallet

Wallets loaded into the *BLOCWallet* client must be synced with the blockchain in order to properly calculate balance, view transaction history, etc.

It is important to properly save the wallet data before exiting *BLOCWallet* so that the synchronized data is not lost.

Here's a quick image of BLOCWallet in action after using the `exit` option while closing BLOCWallet :

![blocwallet](images/BlocWallet/exit.png)
