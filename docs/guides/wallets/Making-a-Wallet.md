# Making a BLOC Wallet

There are multiple different types of wallets you can choose to use for BLOC, paper wallets, CLI wallets, GUI wallets, Mobile wallets, Telegram Wallet and Web Wallets (under development).

We recommend making a paper wallet so that you can start receiving funds, and later import them into a GUI or CLI wallet.

## Paper Wallet

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds.

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI, Mobile, Telegram or Web Wallet.**

To view a guide on how to make a paper wallet, you can go [here](../Making-a-paper-wallet).

## BLOCWallet (CLI Wallet)

The CLI Wallet, called BLOCWallet, is a multi-platform program (Win/Linux/Mac) that requires you to enter commands for it to work and you cannot use your mouse. However, it is currently the most stable and gets the newest updates first.
