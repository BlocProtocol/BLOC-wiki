# **Run your own BLOC Mining Pool**

Pooled mining is a mining approach where multiple generating clients contribute to the generation of a block, and then split the block reward according the contributed processing power. Everyone can run a [BLOC Mining Pool](https://bloc.money/mining), the more BLOC mining pool it exist the better it is for the network. By running a BLOC mining pool the pool operator can set up a % fees on each block mined from this mining pool. Usually this % varies from 0.1% to 5% depending of your mining pool.
