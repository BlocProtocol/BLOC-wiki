It is **likely** you will need to add exceptions and exclusions to your antivirus software in order to make things work properly.

Make sure you have disabled your antivirus and Windows defender before downloading the BLOC GUI Miner else Windows will keep delete the downloaded file.

Choose the best miner following your hardware. We have 2 available binaries for Windows.
