# **About BLOC**

## **When cryptocurrency untraceable payments meets every day life**

**[BLOC](https://bloc.money)** | Symbol: **Ƀ** - Ticker: **BLOC** is a fully decentralized cryptocurrency based on the open source Cryptonote technology, uses ring signatures, ring confidential transactions and stealth addresses meaning payments cannot be tracked or linked back to any user, offering untraceable payements and respect of your private life. Send money worldwide or locally immediately and without costly intermediaries using the blockchain technology.

## **Goals**

Launched in May 2018, one of our main goal is to provide a cryptocurrency which is safe, easy to use and attractive combined with a [powerfull ecosystem](Ecosystem.md) for users to benefits advantages like never before. We are building a complete ecosystem from zero. Connecting buyers and sellers with an innovative approach using full advantage of the global contactless phenomenon to escort with care the mass of users into a new era and provide the use of cryptocurrency instead of conventional payment method. BLOC aims to provide services required to [change the way we pay and get paid](PAYCHANGE.md#cryptocurrencies-mass-adoption-is-near) in our everyday life. Time changes, Payment method too. BLOC creates [PAYCHANGE](PAYCHANGE.md).

Part of our mission is to revolutionize the sport talent management system [creating a custom hardware](TRAAKX-hardware.md) to track and record the activity of an athlete, combined with artificial inteligence to provide the world first action sport tracker based on a blockchain technology offering a whole new world to the sport industry. BLOC creates [TRAAKX](TRAAKX.md).

**Decentralised Fuel to Power the Engine**
All the PAYCHANGE & TRAAKX products and services will be invoiced in the currency BLOC.

Last but not least and maybe the most challenging goal is to connect with entrepreneur’s ready to build new services and products around BLOC to improve the ecosystem. We have so much to decentralize: Private messenger, Social media platform, music & artists, means of transport and much more. We have locked a premine specially dedicated for this kind of projects and we are ready to help you with finance. Let’s build together a better future.

BLOC's code is forked from the [TurtleCoin](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin) code which is itself a fork of [ByteCoin](https://github.com/bcndev/bytecoin), and it has majorly the same privacy features you'll find in [Monero](https://github.com/monero-project/monero). Every transaction is private unless you choose to make it public.

**BLOC** is the cryptocurrency for the people by the people respecting your privacy. Nobody can seize your [BLOC](https://bloc.money). You are the only reponsible of your fund. You and only you can control your fund. You are your own bank. It's about time to take back the control of your money.

While most of the blockchain projects are relying on ICOs to raise funding and promising never coming products, BLOC has decided to do things differently by adopting a no-funding strategy and instead believe in their core mission and vision to grow in the industry.

Providing exceptional products and services like [PAYCHANGE](PAYCHANGE.md) and [TRAAKX](TRAAKX.md) (and many others to come) are key principles enforcing the project to grow at an increasing rate.

Some of the [main features of BLOC](Features.md) include:

- Respect of your privacy
- Fast transactions speed
- Available on multi platform and mobile
- [Easy to mine](../mining/What-is-mining.md)
- Easy to use
- [Amazing community](Community.md)
- Fungible
- Well [documented resources](../service-operators/Resources.md) for developers
- Unrivalated products
- Low & Fix rates per transactions (0.0001 BLOC)

The BLOC Protocol is decentralized and open source meaning [anyone can contribute](Contributing.md) to [BLOC's source code](https://github.com/furiousteam/BLOC) and nobody has central control over the network. Nothing is censored.

Mine BLOC anywhere, anytime. From a mobile phone, Raspberry Pi, a desktop computer or GPU rig and much more, a [complete mining suite of softwares](../mining/How-to-mine-BLOC.md) works well with an egalitarian Proof Of Work using the Cryptonight Haven algorithm which is ASIC resistant and NiceHash resistant.

### **There is already several privacy coins so why do we need a new one ?**

Yes you are right, and this coins already have great communities and developers. However with building BLOC we want to focus on [new services](../about/PAYCHANGE.md) and [innovations](../about/TRAAKX.md) which require their specific needs. This is why we wanted to have our own coin to develop and improve for our purpose and goals.
