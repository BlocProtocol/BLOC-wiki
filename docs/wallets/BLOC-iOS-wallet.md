### **How to backup your wallet and restore it on the BLOC Electron Wallet for Desktop ?**<a name="from-iphone-to-desktop"></a>

You need only the Private Spend Key and the Private View key to import your wallet into the [BLOC Electron Wallet](../wallets/BLOC-Electron-Wallet.md) for desktop.

The 1st 64 characters of your long key is the `spendPublicKey`:

The 2nd 64 characters of your long key is the `viewPublicKey`:
bdbe88916e65aede5dbb13b64228c9087bdbf45a455bd769f9cf03ae6b90b107

The 3rd 64 characters of your long key is the `spendSecretKey`:
3ce56f228cff467d6a2ad98fe15c751efd40e73820b9df08c9e49405dd3af801

The 4th 64 characters of your long key is the `viewSecretKey`:

Now with this details simply use the [BLOC Electron Wallet](../wallets/BLOC-Electron-wallet.md#import-private-keys) and import your iOS wallet on your desktop computer.

## **Mining from iOS**

We had to remove the mining features built in the original **BLOC** app to be able to distribute it on the official app store. It is very important for the **BLOC** to make the installation very easy and accessible to the most potential users.

That being said we are happy to publish our iOS app [open source](https://github.com/furiousteam/BLOC-iOS-wallet) including the miner so everyone can enjoy it.
