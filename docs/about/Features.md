# **BLOC Features**
We are trying to do things no cryptocurrency has ever done before. We already have online few exclusive tools such as the unique [BLOC Javascript web miner](../mining/bloc-in-browser-javascript-web-miner.md) and [BLOC Gui Miner](../mining/BLOC-GUI-Miner.md) but also the **BLOC Wallet for iOS** [available on the App Store](../wallets/BLOC-iOS-wallet.md) or [BLOC Wallet for Telegram](../wallets/BLOC-Telegram-Wallet.md) which makes BLOC instantly available to over 200 million+ users worldwide.

Discover the [BLOC Dashboard](../guides/dashboard/dashboard.md) and join the AirDrop mission to grab your very 1st BLOC.

What about making some passive income while sleeping with the [sleep mining](../mining/mobile-mining/Sleep-Mining.md) ?

We are trying to build the most advanced ecosystem ever created for a cryptocurrency to be able to use BLOC and cryptocurrencies as a payment method in the everyday life.

## **Decentralized**
The decentralized control of [BLOC](https://bloc.money) works through a blockchain, which is a public transaction database, functioning as a distributed ledger. The Blockchain is the technology allowing to send money without the need of intermediaries. Decentralized BLOC cryptocurrency is produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which was defined when the system was created and which is publicly known. Unlike centralized banking and corrupted economic system, in this case companies or governments cannot produce new BLOC.money units. There will be a total of **50 Million BLOC coins distributed until the year 2046**. At BLOC, we believe that access to knowledge is what truly allows great ideas to flourish and diverse communities to grow. We believe that BLOC is what the [community](../about/Community.md) decides it to be and that decisions on how to grow the protocol should involve everyone. BLOC is accessible by anyone in the world regardless of their geographic location or status.

## **Private**
[BLOC](https://bloc.money) uses ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses to obfuscate the origins, amounts, and destinations of all transactions. It means that nobody can track your transactions and knows that you made a transaction, it means also that nobody can see the content of your wallet/asset. BLOC is 100 times more private than the Bitcoin. We use advanced mathematical analysis and innovative ideas to empower end-users with true privacy.

## **Fast transactions speed**
The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. This is practically when the money transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. [BLOC](https://bloc.money) has a 120 seconds block time which is 5 times faster than Bitcoin allowing new possibilities to spend BLOC on a every day life. We can easily imagine paying in BLOC at any local store almost instantly.

## **True egalitarian proof of work**
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are earned by “mining” them with expensive server equipment. BLOC is the most advanced cryptocurrency that can be “mined” using just your internet access and almost any device. Easy to mine from multiple hardware, [BLOC](https://bloc.money) Proof Of Work Cryptonight Haven algorithm is designed to make low end and high end hardware mining roughly equally efficient and restrict ASIC mining. That means if you are using a smartphone or a normal computer or any other low end hardware, you will be able to mine BLOC.money with the same probability of coin reward making BLOC.money a uniquely egalitarian currency. BLOC avoids many concerns, e.g. technological, environment impact, reputational and security, of Bitcoin, and provides a glimpse of the future. BLOC makes mining eco-friendly. Everybody can mine BLOC. **You are mining REAL (BLOC) coins coming from the blockchain block reward.**

## **Untraceable**
When you send or receive [BLOC](https://bloc.money) through the BLOC network, the sender, the receiver and the transacted amount are anonymous by default. Nobody can know if you sent or received BLOC and nobody can know how much BLOC you sent. All the transaction through the blockchain are untraceable and so it's impossible to link transactions to a particular user and so can't be linked to a real world identity even by the founder team of the BLOC. However we have a feature called the view key to offer transparency which is described next.

## **Secure**
A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets. [BLOC](https://bloc.money) transactions are confirmed by distributed consensus and then immutably recorded on the blockchain. No third party is required to keep your BLOC safe. Nobody can seize your BLOC. You are the only reponsible of your fund. You and only you can control your fund. You are your own bank.

## **Transparent on demand**
[BLOC](https://bloc.money) is optionnaly and on-demand transparent by address and by transaction. There is a thing called the view key. A view key is used to reveal all transactions for a BLOC account, or just the key for a single transaction without being able to spend thos account funds. View keys can be given to selected parties, or can be made public for crowdfunding or charity events, children can be given their own accounts, and parents can monitor their spending. It's like: Hey! You can look, but you can't touch!

## **Adaptive parameters**
A decentralized payment system must not depend on a single person's decisions, even if this person is a developer. [BLOC](https://bloc.money) has no hard-coded constants; magic numbers in the code are designed to be re-calculated based on the previous state of the network. Thus, they always change adaptively and independently, allowing the network to develop on its own. We are listening and encourage our community to vote and participate in different subject to make BLOC better day by day.

## **Fungible**
Def. : "being something (such as money) of such a nature that one part or quantity may be replaced by another equal part". It means that any [BLOC](https://bloc.money) is equal in all point to any other BLOC. Whatever the previous use of the BLOC, it is always neutral as nobody can know where and when the BLOC has been used previously. So each coins has no history on the blockchain. No one has the possibility to rewrite or modify the Blockchain ledger, the protocol is unalterable and incorruptible by nature.

## **Double spending**
Nobody is able to spend the same [BLOC](https://bloc.money) money twice — even if all his signatures are anonymous. Every signature contains a key image — a kind of fingerprint of the secret key. It is based on a one-way cryptographic function; this implies that given only the key image it is impossible to restore the corresponding secret key. These key images are used to prevent double-spending.
