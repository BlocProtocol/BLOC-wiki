# **Making a BLOC.MONEY - (BLOC) Wallet**

There are multiple different types of wallets you can choose to use for [BLOC](https://bloc.money), [Paper wallets](../wallets/Making-a-paper-wallet.md), [CLI Wallet](../wallets/BLOCWallet-how-to-use.md), [GUI Wallet](../wallets/Making-a-GUI-Wallet.md), [iOS Wallet](../wallets/BLOC-iOS-wallet.md), [Telegram Wallet](../wallets/BLOC-Telegram-Wallet.md) and Web Wallets (under development).

We recommend making a paper wallet so that you can start receiving funds, and later import them into a GUI or CLI wallet.

## **BLOC Paper Wallet**

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds.

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI or Desktop (GUI) Wallet.**

## **BLOCWallet (CLI Wallet)**

The CLI Wallet, called [BLOCWallet](../wallets/BLOCWallet-how-to-use.md), is a multi-platform program (Win/Linux/Mac) that requires you to enter commands for it to work and you cannot use your mouse. It is text only application that does not have a graphical interface. However, it is currently the most stable and gets the newest updates first.
