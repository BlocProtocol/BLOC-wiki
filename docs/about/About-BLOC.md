# About BLOC

## NO ICO?
[BLOC](https://bloc.money) differentiates itself from others as there has been no initial coin offering made to fund and launch the project. As we believe that there are too many ico’s poppin out every day without real products, providing exceptional products and services are key principles enforcing the project to grow at an increasing rate. Therefore, the developing team invested themselves all their time and savings into the BLOC.

## BLOC Features
We are trying to do things no cryptocurrency has everyone before. We already have online few exclusive tools such as the unique **BLOC** [JAVASCRIPT WEB MINER](https://bloc-mining.com) but also the **BLOC Wallet for iOS** [available on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bloc-wallet-by-furiousteam-ltd/id1437924269?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D2) or [BLOC Wallet for Telegram](https://t.me/bloc_wallet_bot) which makes BLOC instantly available to over 200 million+ users worldwide. Discover the [BLOC Dashboard](https://dashboard.bloc.money) and join the AirDrop mission to grab your very 1st BLOC. What about making some passive income while sleeping with the [sleep mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGVfNRHJ3ac). We are trying to build the most advanced ecosystem ever created for a cryptocurrency. Much more is coming soon. Feel free to visit our website [BLOC.MONEY](https://bloc.money) not to miss any news.

### Decentralized
The decentralized control of [BLOC](https://bloc.money) works through a blockchain, which is a public transaction database, functioning as a distributed ledger. The Blockchain is the technology allowing to send money without the need of intermediaries. Decentralized [BLOC](https://bloc.money) cryptocurrency is produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which was defined when the system was created and which is publicly known. Unlike centralized banking and corrupted economic system, in this case companies or governments cannot produce new BLOC.money units. There will be a total of 50 Millions BLOC.money distributed until the year 2046.

### Private
[BLOC](https://bloc.money) uses ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses to obfuscate the origins, amounts, and destinations of all transactions. It means that nobody can track your transactions and knows that you made a transaction, it means also that nobody can see the content of your wallet/asset. [BLOC](https://bloc.money) is 100 times more private than the Bitcoin. We use advanced mathematical analysis and innovative ideas to empower end-users with true privacy.

### Fast transactions speed
The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. This is practically when the money transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. [BLOC](https://bloc.money) has a 120 seconds block time which is 5 times faster than Bitcoin allowing new possibilities to spend [BLOC](https://bloc.money) on a every day life. We can easily imagine paying in BLOC at any local store almost instantly.

### True egalitarian proof of work
An amazing feature that balance the low end hardware, middle and high end hardware. That means that even if you use a smartphone or a normal computer or any other low end hardware, you will be able to mine the [BLOC](https://bloc.money) with the same probabilty of coin reward. On top of that we have updated the core of [BLOC](https://bloc.money) to be ASIC resistant using the latest Cryptonight Haven algorythm which is a derive of Monero. Everybody can mine the [BLOC](https://bloc.money) with a true egalitarian proof of work (POW) and money distribution. We also have setup different mining pool for each continent to offer a better connectivity and improve your earnings. **You are mining REAL BLOC MONEY coming from the Blockchain block reward.**

### Untraceable
When you send or receive [BLOC](https://bloc.money) through the [BLOC.MONEY](https://bloc.money) network, the sender, the receiver and the transacted amount are anonymous by default. Nobody can know if you sent or received BLOC and nobody can know how much [BLOC](https://bloc.money) you sent. All the transaction through the blockchain are untraceable and so it's impossible to link transactions to a particular user and so can't be linked to a real world identity even by the founder team of the [BLOC](https://bloc.money). However we have a feature called the view key to offer transparency which is described next.

### Secure
A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets. [BLOC](https://bloc.money) transactions are confirmed by distributed consensus and then immutably recorded on the blockchain. No third party is required to keep your [BLOC.MONEY](https://bloc.money) safe. Nobody can seize your [BLOC](https://bloc.money). You are the only reponsible of your fund. You and only you can control your fund. You are your own bank.

### Transparent on demand
[BLOC](https://bloc.money) is optionnaly and on-demand transparent by address and by transaction. There is a thing called the view key. A view key is used to reveal all transactions for a [BLOC](https://bloc.money) account, or just the key for a single transaction without being able to spend thos account funds. View keys can be given to selected parties, or can be made public for crowdfunding or charity events, children can be given their own accounts, and parents can monitor their spending. It's like: Hey! You can look, but you can't touch!

### Adaptive parameters
A decentralized payment system must not depend on a single person's decisions, even if this person is a developer. [BLOC](https://bloc.money) has no hard-coded constants; magic numbers in the code are designed to be re-calculated based on the previous state of the network. Thus, they always change adaptively and independently, allowing the network to develop on its own. We are listening and encourage our community to vote and participate in different subject to make [BLOC](https://bloc.money) better day by day.

### Fungible
Def. : "being something (such as money) of such a nature that one part or quantity may be replaced by another equal part". It means that any [BLOC](https://bloc.money) is equal in all point to any other [BLOC](https://bloc.money). Whatever the previous use of the BLOC, it is always neutral as nobody can know where and when the [BLOC](https://bloc.money) has been used previously. So each coins has no history on the blockchain. No one has the possibility to rewrite or modify the Blockchain ledger, the protocol is unalterable and incorruptible by nature.

### Double spending
Nobody is able to spend the same [BLOC](https://bloc.money) money twice — even if all his signatures are anonymous. Every signature contains a key image — a kind of fingerprint of the secret key. It is based on a one-way cryptographic function; this implies that given only the key image it is impossible to restore the corresponding secret key. These key images are used to prevent double-spending.

This is the core implementation of [BLOC.MONEY](https://bloc.money). It is open source and completely free to use without restrictions, except for those specified in the license agreement below. There are no restrictions on anyone creating an alternative implementation of [BLOC](https://bloc.money) that uses the protocol and network in a compatible manner.

## About this project

As with many development projects, the repository on Github is considered to be the "staging" area for the latest changes. Before changes are merged into that branch on the main repository, they are tested by individual developers in their own branches, submitted as a pull request, and then subsequently tested by contributors who focus on testing and code reviews. That having been said, the repository should be carefully considered before using it in a production environment, unless there is a patch in the repository for a particular show-stopping issue you are experiencing. It is generally a better idea to use a tagged release for stability.

**Anyone is welcome to contribute to BLOC's codebase!** If you have a fix or code change, feel free to submit it as a pull request directly to the "master" branch. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not affect other parts of the codebase it may be merged in immediately by any one of the collaborators. On the other hand, if the change is particularly large or complex, it is expected that it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.
