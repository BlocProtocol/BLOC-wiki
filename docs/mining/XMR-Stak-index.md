# **What is XMR-STAK ?**

XMR-Stak - Cryptonight All-in-One Mining Software

XMR-STAK is the only program that supports mining with CPU, NVIDIA GPUs and AMD GPUs. Also it is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS. XMR-Stak is a universal stratum pool miner to mine crypto currencies like Monero, Electroneum, [BLOC](https://bloc.money) and basically any coins that are powered by cryptonight and cryptonight_lite algorithm.

XMR Stak is well optimized and it is known to significantly generate more hashrates than any other miners. Here in this beginners guide weâ€™ll be showing you how to use XMR-STAK and start mining [BLOC](https://bloc.money).

## **Features**

* support all common backends (CPU/x86, AMD-GPU and NVIDIA-GPU)
* support all common OS (Linux, Windows and macOS)
* supports algorithm cryptonight for Monero (XMR) and cryptonight-light (AEON)
* easy to use
* guided start (no need to edit a config file for the first start)
* auto-configuration for each backend
* open source software (GPLv3)
* TLS support
* HTML statistics
* JSON API for monitoring

## **Download****

* You can find the latest releases and precompiled binaries on GitHub under [Releases](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/releases)
* Or compile yourself using the [Source code](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/releases)
* [Compile instructions](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/blob/master/doc/compile.md) from XMR-Stak Github.

## **HTML and JSON API report configuration**

To configure the reports you need to edit the `httpd_port variable`. Then enable wifi on your phone and navigate to `[miner ip address]:[httpd_port]` in your phone browser. If you want to use the data in scripts, you can get the JSON version of the data at url `[miner ip address]:[httpd_port]/api.json`

This is how it looks :

## **Default Developer Donation**

By default, the XMR-STAK will donate 2% of the hashpower (2 minutes in 100 minutes) to XMR-stak developers pool.
If you want to change that, edit [donate-level.hpp](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/blob/master/xmrstak/donate-level.hpp) before you build the binaries.
