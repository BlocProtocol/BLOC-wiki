# **Making a BLOC Wallet**

There are multiple different types of wallets you can choose to use for [BLOC](https://bloc.money), paper wallets, [CLI Wallet](../wallets/Using-BLOCWallet.md), GUI wallets, [iOS Wallet](../wallets/BLOC-iOS-wallet.md), [Telegram Wallet](../wallets/BLOC-Telegram-Wallet.md) and Web Wallets (under development).

We recommend making a paper wallet so that you can start receiving funds, and later import them into a GUI or CLI wallet.

## **Paper Wallet**

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds.

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI, Mobile, Telegram or Web Wallet.**

## **BLOCWallet (CLI Wallet)**

The CLI Wallet, called BLOCWallet, is a multi-platform program (Win/Linux/Mac) that requires you to enter commands for it to work and you cannot use your mouse. It is text only application that does not have a graphical interface. However, it is currently the most stable and gets the newest updates first.
