# **How to Mine BLOC?**<a name="how-to-mine"></a>

Unfortunately because of some bad people using mining software in malware, most antivirus software will detect the programs below as unsafe.

It is **likely** you will need to add exceptions and exclusions to your antivirus software in order to make things work properly. Unless you know what you are doing, please ***only*** download from the links below.

There are currently a few different ways in which you can start mining [BLOC](https://bloc.money):

## **1. In-browser BLOC javascript web miner**

[In-browser BLOC web miner](../mining/bloc-in-browser-javascript-web-miner.md) was designed and built to allow virtually anyone with internet access and a browser to mine the cryptocurrency known as Ƀ [BLOC](https://bloc.money). In-browser miner is easy to use and has all the latest web mining capabilities built in. You do not have to download or configure any software to get started mining with your computer, mobile phone or any device running a web browser.

To start mining **BLOC** with the **In-browser web miner**, you can check out [this guide](../mining/bloc-in-browser-javascript-web-miner.md).

## **2. XMR-Stak - Cryptonight All-in-One Mining Software**

[XMR-STAK](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak) is the only program that supports mining with CPU, NVIDIA GPUs and AMD GPUs. Also it is available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS and more. **XMR-stak** is a universal stratum pool miner to mine crypto currencies like Monero, Electroneum, [BLOC](https://bloc.money) and basically any coins that are powered by cryptonight algorithm.

XMR Stak is well optimized and it is known to significantly generate more hashrates than any other miners.

## **3. XMRig Miner**

[XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) is a little bit different to XMR-Stak, you need to download a CPU and GPU miner separately and run two separate instances in your computer. One will use your CPU and the other one will use your GPU. **XMRig** is a high performance Monero (XMR) and [BLOC](https://bloc.money) CPU miner, with official support for Windows, Mac Linux and more.

## **4. Mobile Mining**

Using your mobile to mine **BLOC** 24/7 is not advised and should only be done for the fun. It may also cause the phone to overheat and result in premature silicon degradation, shortening the lifespan of your phone. However mining during the night while you are sleeping and not using your mobile phone can be an interesting option and may be profitable.

Check out the two options available to mine BLOC from a mobile phone:

* The most easy way to mine **BLOC** from your mobile phone is using the [BLOC Web Miner](../mining/bloc-in-browser-javascript-web-miner.md)

* Introducing [Sleep Mining for BLOC](../mining/mobile-mining/Sleep-Mining.md) — Make extra cash while you are sleeping using your mobile phone
