# **How to use BLOC GUI Miner**

If you want to learn about cryptocurrencies, [mining](../mining/What-is-mining.md) is a great place to start!

This page describe how to use the BLOC GUI Miner and getting started mining cryptocurrency on [Windows](../mining/BLOC-GUI-Miner.md#windows), [Mac OS](../mining/BLOC-GUI-Miner.md#mac) and [Linux](../mining/BLOC-GUI-Miner.md#linux) using CPU and/or GPU hardware.

[Start mining](../mining/BLOC-GUI-Miner-using.md#start-mining) today and get rewarded in your favorite cryptocurrency.

## **Download binaries and source code**

Download binaries and source code from the [BLOC GUI Miner](https://github.com/furiousteam/BLOC-GUI-Miner) GitHub rep.

## **Linux**<a name="linux">

Choose the best miner following your hardware. We have 4 available binaries for Linux. 

- BLOC GUI Miner with [XMR-STAK CPU](https://github.com/furiousteam/GUI-miner/releases/latest) binaries for **CPU** mining

## **XMR-STAK Settings and configuration**

XMR-Stak will save your configuration in **config.txt** in the same directory from which it was first run.

Your configuration for pools(algorithm to mine, address, port etc) will be saved in **pools.txt**
The configuration of the device it mines(CPU/AMD/NVIDIA) will be saved in **cpu.txt**, **amd.txt** or **nvidia.txt**, respectively.

Run XMR-Stak again from the same directory to reuse the configuration.

## **Default Developer Donation**

By default, the XMR-STAK will donate 2% of the hashpower (2 minutes in 100 minutes) to XMR-stak developers pool.
If you want to change that, edit [donate-level.hpp](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/blob/master/xmrstak/donate-level.hpp) before you build the binaries. We strongly recommend to leave this donation fee at least 1% to help the **XMR-stak** developers by providing regular updates. To find how to build XMR-STAK on your system follow [this guide](../mining/XMR-Stak-index.md).

## **I have my own miner**<a name="use-my-binaries"></a>

You are welcome to use your own [xmr-stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak) or [xmrig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) binaries as long as it is the same version compatible with the BLOC GUI Miner available on this page.

Use the standard procedure to compile your favorite miner and place the binaries file inside the miner folder next to the BLOC GUI Miner application. Once you are ready simply double click the BLOC GUI Miner icon to launch the application and [start mining](../mining/BLOC-GUI-Miner.md#start-mining).

For the mining stats to display correctly you need to enable the API for each miner by doing the following:

Compiling XMR-STAK with option: **-DMICROHTTPD_ENABLE=ON**

Ensure you have the following in you config.txt file

`"httpd_port" : 16000,`

Compiling XMRIG with option: by default **-DWITH_HTTPD=ON** should be enabled.

Ensure you have the following in you config.json file
```
"api":{
  "port":16000,
  "access-token":null,
  "worker-id":null
}
```

## **Mining Tuning Intensity and threads configuration**

XMR-STAK gives too many options for tuning to get the best results out of your hardware. By default the miner creates config file for CPU, NVIDIA and AMD GPU. You can edit the values within these text files and see which works best for your mining hardware. Change the value of intensity, work-size, threads and blocks. You can add more GPUs and also lower the power mode of your CPU.

For more information on Tuning and configuring your hardware in XMR-stak we suggest you to read [this guide](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/blob/master/doc/tuning.md)

## **I'm on Linux and get the error**

`creating window failed: canceller.cancelled`.
This seems to be because of missing libraries on Ubuntu 17.10 and higher, also impacts other Ubuntu flavours.
To resolve the issue, a GNOME package needs to be installed, run the following:

`sudo apt-get install libgconf-2-4`

## **I keep getting the 'no compatible miner found' error**

Your antivirus most likely removed the miner before you could exclude the folder from being scanned. If you followed the antivirus guides in the initial setup you can simply extract the miner again, replacing the current files, and run the GUI miner again.

If you haven't exluded the miner's folder from being scanned, do so now and run the GUI miner again.

If you built your own version of xmr-stak or xmrig you need to rename the binaries to xmr-stak and xmrig respectively.

## **I'd like to use a pool that is not listed**

We currently only list pools we have tested in the miner. You are free to change the config for xmrig and xmr-stak to rather use a pool you want.

XMRIG
Edit the config.json file in the miner folder
```
"pools":[
	{
		"url":"pool.example:6666",
		"user":"your-BLOC-address",
		"pass":"BLOC GUI Miner",
		"keepalive":true,
		"nicehash":false,
		"variant":"xhv"
	}
],
```
              
XMR-STAK
Edit the pools.txt file in the miner folder
```
"pool_list":
[
  {
    "pool_address" : "pool.example:3333",
    "wallet_address" : "your-BLOC-address",
    "rig_id" : "",
    "pool_password" : "BLOC GUI Miner",
    "use_nicehash" : false,
    "use_tls" : false,
    "tls_fingerprint" : "",
    "pool_weight" : 1
  },
],
"currency" : "cryptonight_haven",
```
