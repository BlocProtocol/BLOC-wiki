We can see there the total hashes submitted including the pending balance. It still shows 0 right now because blocks from the blockchain require 50 confirmations for the mining reward to be distributed. As we know the block time is 2 minutes so this means we will be able to see the first pending balance in about 2 hours if blocks are found of course from this pool.

Ok so i left my MacBook pro mining for about 12 hours. We can see that i already received a payment from the mining pool, its’s here about 1 BLOC’. And i still have 0.2 something in the pending balance because im still mining.

### Wallet Optimization

If you are mining, it is highly recommended to enable wallet optimization (Settings > Preferences > Wallet Optimization) because you will be more prone to transition getting stuck if you’re wallet isn’t optimized. Transaction size increases if you have many small transactions amount on your wallet, and try to send a big amount in one transaction.
