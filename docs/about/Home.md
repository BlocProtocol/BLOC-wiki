# **About BLOC**

When cryptocurrency untraceable payments meets every day life.

**[BLOC](https://bloc.money)** | Symbol: **Éƒ** - Ticker: **[BLOC](https://bloc.money)** is a fully decentralized cryptocurrency based on the open source Cryptonote technology, uses ring signatures, ring confidential transactions and stealth addresses meaning payments cannot be tracked or linked back to any user, offering untraceable payements and respect of your private life. Send money worldwide or locally immediately and without costly intermediaries using the blockchain technology.

Launched in May 2018 one of BLOC's main goals is to focus on accessibility, security and simplicity to make the use of cryptocurrency easy in the everyday life for everyone by creating a cryptocurrency which is valuable, attractive and fun to use but also building a powerfull ecosystem where you can live and pay with BLOC and cryptocurrencies for your daily purchases.

**BLOC** is the cryptocurrency for the people by the people with respect of your privacy and real working products like [PAYCHANGE](PAYchange.md) and [TRAAKX](TRAAKX.md).

Nobody can seize your [BLOC](https://bloc.money). You are the only reponsible of your fund. You and only you can control your fund. You are your own bank. It's about time to take back the control of your money.

While most of the blockchain projects are relying on ICOs to raise funding and promising never coming products, BLOC has decided to do things differently by adopting a no-funding strategy and instead believe in their core mission and vision to grow in the industry.

Providing exceptional products and services are key principles enforcing the project to grow at an increasing rate.

Some of the [main features of BLOC](Features.md) include:

- Respect of your privacy
- Fast transactions speed
- Available on multi platform and mobile
- [Easy to mine](../mining/What-is-mining.md)
- Easy to use
- [Amazing community](Community.md)
- Fungible
- Well [documented resources](../service-operators/Resources.md) for developers
- Unrivalated products
- Low & Fix rates per transactions (0.0001 BLOC)
- The BLOC Protocol is decentralized and open source meaning [anyone can contribute](Contributing.md) to [BLOC's source code](https://github.com/furiousteam/BLOC) and nobody has central control over the network. Nothing is censored.

Mine BLOC anywhere, anytime. From a mobile phone, Raspberry Pi, a desktop computer or GPU rig and much more, a [complete mining suite of softwares](../mining/How-to-mine-BLOC.md) works well with an egalitarian Proof Of Work using the Cryptonight Haven algorithm which is ASIC resistant and NiceHash resistant.

## **There is already several privacy coins so why do we need a new one ?**

Yes you are right, and this coins already have great communities and developers. However with building BLOC we want to focus on [new services](../about/PAYCHANGE.md) and [innovations](../about/TRAAKX.md) which require their specific needs. This is why we wanted to have our own coin to develop and improve for our purpose and goals.
