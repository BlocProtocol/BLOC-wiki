# **What is mining ?**
Mining is the process of adding transaction records to cryptocurency public ledger of past transactions. This ledger of past transactions is called the blockchain as it is a chain of blocks. Mining needs a device such as a computer or mobile device and a special program, which helps miners compete with their peers in solving complicated mathematical problems. Mining is so called because it resembles the mining of other commodities: it requires exertion and it slowly makes new currency available at a rate that resembles the rate at which commodities like gold are mined from the ground.

If you want to learn about cryptocurrencies, mining is a great place to start!. [Start mining today](../mining/How-to-mine-BLOC.md) and get rewarded in **BLOC**

## **Egalitarian Proof of Work**

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are earned by “mining” them with expensive server equipment. BLOC is the most advanced cryptocurrency that can be “mined” using just your internet access and almost any device. Easy to mine from multiple hardware, BLOC Proof Of Work Cryptonight Haven algorithm is designed to make low end and high end hardware mining roughly equally efficient and restrict ASIC mining.

This means if you are using a smartphone or a normal computer or any other low end hardware, you will be able to mine BLOC.money with the same probability of coin reward making BLOC.money a uniquely egalitarian currency. BLOC avoids many concerns, e.g. technological, environment impact, reputational and security, of Bitcoin, and provides a glimpse of the future. BLOC makes mining eco-friendly. Everybody can mine [BLOC](https://bloc.money).
