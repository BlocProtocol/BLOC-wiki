Each BLOC wallet gets a unique set of 64 characters private keys called spendSecretKey and viewSecretKey.

- Write down your private keys. It is the only way to restore your wallet.
- Keep it secret and safe. If you save it an insecure location you might loose your funds.
- Do not store on your smartphone, tablet or computer. Only you are responsible for the security of your funds.

This is a web wallet created by BLOC Dashboard. For large amount, more security and better privacy please create a cold-storage [paper walet](../wallets/Making-a-paper-wallet.md) and use the BLOC dashboard wallet as a daily wallet. The BLOC Dashboard is safe and secure but it is an online wallet. The less funds available on this wallet, the better it is.
