# **Who ? Why ? How ? created the BLOC**

[BLOC](https://bloc.money) was created by Steve Palma and Thomas Gayet in December 2017 and launched in public the 22th may 2018

## **Why the BLOC ?**

We are passionate about crypto currency and truly convinced that blockchain technology is going to change our world. Too many ICO's are popping up everday without real products at the end and a lot of disapointement. We decided to do it differently. [BLOC.MONEY](https://bloc.money) is a true and real mining crypto currency like Bitcoin, using improved adaptive features to fit our current world and economy including exclusive mining tools to offer an egalitarian money distribution. Providing exceptional products and services are key principles enforcing the project to grow at an increasing rate.

## **Goals**

One of our main goal is to provide a cryptocurrency which is safe, easy to use, fun with a strong buying power so you can benefits advantages like never before. We are building a complete ecosystem from zero. Connecting buyers and sellers with an innovative approach using full advantage of the global contactless phenomenon to escort with care the mass of users into a new era and provide the use of cryptocurrency instead of conventional payment method. BLOC aims to provide services required to change the way we pay and get paid in our everyday life. Time changes, Payment method too. BLOC creates PAYCHANGE.

Part of our mission is to revolutionize the sport talent management system using advanced hardware to track and record the activity of an athlete, combined with artificial inteligence and provide the world first action sport tracker based on a blockchain technology offering a whole new world to the sport industry. BLOC creates TRAAKX.

**Decentralised Fuel to Power the Engine**
All the PAYCHANGE & TRAAKX products and services will be invoiced in the currency BLOC.

Last but not least and maybe the most challenging goal is to connect with entrepreneur’s ready to change the world and offer new services and products built around BLOC to improve the ecosystem. We have so much to decentralize: Private messenger, Social media platform, music & artists, means of transport and much more. Contibute today us and let’s build together a better future !

## **Why a premine ?**

We have a long road map and big plans coming up for BLOC that require proper funding to achive these goals on time. BLOC was created and financed by ourself since the beggining such as developer salary, web servers and all the other extra costs. We will be using parts of the premine wallet during the life time of the BLOC project to finance research and development of new services and applications to improve the BLOC. Part of this premine wallet will be used as BOUNTY to reward users involved in the promotion of BLOC. We premined a total of 5 million BLOC which represent 10% of the maximum supply available in 2046.

## **How the BLOC was created ?**

As you may be aware, the [Cryptnote White Paper](https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf) set out the initial specification for CryptoNote coins. The ByteCoin developers created the first implementation of this specification working closely with the CryptoNote developers, and this is what has become [ByteCoin](https://github.com/bcndev/bytecoin) today. This was forked early on to become Bitmonero, and then [Monero](https://github.com/monero-project/monero). The Monero developers have contributed back significant chunks of code to the original ByteCoin codebase, and of course, they maintain their own repositories and code.

The **ForkNote Project** was created as a fork of **ByteCoin**, to create a way to fork ByteCoin, easily by separating the needed constants and strings out into a separate file.

BLOC then forked the [ForkNote Project](https://github.com/forknote/forknote) back in December 2017 and made our own changes for a public launch the 22nd May 2018.

While we were working on our project we discovered about [TurtleCoin](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin), another cryptocurrency based on [Cryptonote](https://github.com/cryptonotefoundation/cryptonote) with some similarity with [BLOC](https://bloc.money). Like RockSteady (the founder of TurtleCoin) said:

```
Too many projects are bringing in too much funding despite most having no damn product. We figured, "why not do the whole thing in reverse? Start with a fun project, make it as simple and accessible as possible, and let it grow on its own."

We have a strong belief in our no-funding strategy; if we make a cool product, the value will create itself.
```

At [BLOC](https://bloc.money) we want to focus on the simplicity and efficiency of cryptocurrency to be used in a everyday life around the world without barrier including a rich ecosystem by providing easy to use and powerfull services to pay and get paid with cryptocurrency.

End of october we have migrated the core of **TurtleCoin** into **BLOC** and made our own modifications which now make the [BLOC 3.0](https://github.com/furiousteam/BLOC), some of which were then contributed back to TurtleCoin and as a community, we’re keen on helping those who’ve helped us. We will be happy to provide our services and knowledge to the TurtleCoin project and support it along their road.

## **Our background and history**

It all started back in 2004 when Steve and Igor created a famous software for NEC mobile phones. Daniel managed to find a way to hack us, this is how we met. Since then we made miracles. Christophe at this time was our best customer and become a really close partner and propulsed us to wild mobile phone industry in China.

[FuriousTeam](https://furiousteam.com was born. Our team of developers managed by Speedy spent a lot of late hours at the office polishing the best code for our websites. Later we understood that designs are a key feature for our projects and we met Thomas back in 2010. Maxime is a young member but a very important addition to our team concerning the upcoming iOs projects. Paul is the youngest of our team and he is ready to show you what is he capable of.

Together we have built [FuriousGold](https://furiousgold.com) which is still today the world most advanced unlocking software for mobile phones and we are ready to entertain you with our new project [BLOC](https://bloc.money)
