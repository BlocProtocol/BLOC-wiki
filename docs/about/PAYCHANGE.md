BLOC is building the ecosystem for the Cryptocurrency era. People will be able to use, spend, exchange any type of cryptocurrency in the same way as they could with any other currency, but in a quicker, cheaper and more secure environment than it is currently possible in any traditional bank or other current exchange.

BLOC with PAYCHANGE will be the core which will interlock the limited financial world in today's societies and a future Cryptoeconomy with limitless nationwide possibilities.

"Most of the technology for this financial revolution already exists: Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Alipay; the world’s biggest banks and payment platforms have already installed more than 42 million contactless payment terminals throughout the world, a number that is proliferating."

PAYCHANGE will fully take advantage of the global contactless phenomenon and provide the use of cryptocur- rencies instead of conventional payment cards using fiat currencies through mobile devices.

PAYCHANGE aims to provide services required to change the way we pay and get paid in our everyday life, by delivering one of the best Cryptocurrency online secure platforms to use, buy, sell, and transfer, while connec- ting buyers and sellers.

There is no website and application where you can find a worldwide map with all the places accepting crypto-currencies in a very effective and simple way to redirect from buyers to the sellers.
