# Using trtlbot++

## Registering your Wallet

Go to the `#bots` channel in the [Discord server](http://chat.turtlecoin.lol), and type `.registerwallet abLoc...`, and replace `abLoc...` with your wallet address.

For example, you would type-

```
.registerwallet abLocv3pFrFm2yk4cYNtKf5fxV1b594tNrZfEV2CYWJsTSqr9BWoWMrUNpQaeD9StrzQrxpRQKPCdd1FfvT6D6dAg4pY6iB7sqsG
```

## Depositing Turtle

After your wallet address has been registered, type `.deposit` in the `#bots` channel, then:

* Check for a new direct message from trtlbot++
* Copy the line of code he gives (excluding the `Integrated Address:`) and enter that as the address of the recipient  

**No Payment ID!**

#### CLI Wallet

* See [Expected Results](#expected-results) section below

***PLEASE ENTER YOUR OWN VALUES WHICH THE BOT SENDS YOU!***

### Expected Results

When the bot receives the payment, it will send you a PM letting you know. Now you can tip people!

## Checking your Balance

Before you can tip, you need to know your balance. Your balance is the amount of abLoc you have in your tipjar wallet to tip to others.

To check your balance, type `.balance`. trtlbot++ will PM you with how much balance you have remaining in your tipjar wallet.

![balance](images/trtlbot-plus-plus/balance.png)

If it shows `0.00`, then make sure you have [deposited](#depositing-turtle) some abLoc and it has [been received](#expected-results)

## Tipping People
To tip someone, type `.tip 12345 @person`.

Replace `12345` with how much you want to tip the person.  
Replace `@person` with whom you want to tip it to.

For example, `.tip 1 @RockSteady#7588` will tip the user called "RockSteady"  1 abLoc.

*The minimum you can send is 0.01 abLoc, and the bot will take an extra 0.1 abLoc on top of what you tipped to account for fees
So if you tipped 1 abLoc, 1.1 abLoc will be pulled from your account so that the full 1 abLoc reaches the recipient*

### Adding a Message when Tipping

***The syntax for tipping someone is- `.tip 12345 @person`***

- Trying to add a message before it, will not work.  
   For example,

   ```
   hey .tip 1 @RockSteady#7588
   ```



   will **not** send RockSteady 1 abLoc.

   ---

- Trying to add it on a seperate line in 1 message will not work.  
  For example,
  ```
  heyo there.
  I'm tipping you

  .tip 1 @RockSteady#7588
  ```

  will **not** send RockSteady 1 abLoc.

  ---

- Trying to add a message *after* it will **will** work.  
  For example,

   ```
   .tip 1 @RockSteady#7588 hey
   ```



   **will** send RockSteady 1 abLoc

   ---

- Trying to add a message after the command on a separate line in an existing message **will** work.  
  For example,
  ```
  .tip 1 @RockSteady#7588

  hey
  ```
  **will** send RockSteady 1 abLoc.

  ---

- Trying to add a message *between* the *amount* and the *recipient* **will** work.  
  For example,

  ```
  .tip  1 hey @RockSteady#7588
  ```

   **will** send RockSteady 1 abLoc.

  ---

- If you make a typo in the command, and try to edit the message to fix the typo, it will **not** work.

   â€‹
**Basically, keep these in mind-**  

* Any text must go **after** the command
  - It may also go in **between** the **amount** and **recipient**
* Trying to **edit** the command will *not* work


### Tipping with Emojis

Reacting with the emoji ![99](images/trtlbot-plus-plus/almost100.png) on someone's message will tip them 99 abLoc.

If someone has tipped someone, then reacting with ![tip](images/trtlbot-plus-plus/rsz_tip.png) on the message on which they tipped the person (`.tip 1 @RockSteady#7588`) will send the recipient (in this case, RockSteady) the same amount he was originally tipped (in this case, 1).    
So the recipient (RockSteady) gets 2 abLoc.

Reacting with ![tip](images/trtlbot-plus-plus/rsz_tip.png) on a message where in a person was tipped with the emoji ![99](images/trtlbot-plus-plus/almost100.png) will **not** tip the original poster of the message 99 abLoc.  
You *can* react with the emoji ![99](images/trtlbot-plus-plus/almost100.png) (again) however, to tip the person 99 abLoc.

### Tipping Multiple People

The syntax for tipping multiple people is- `.tip 1 <@person1 @person2>`

For example, `.tip 1 @RockSteady#7588 @bebop#2640`

This will tip RockSteady *and* bebop 1 abLoc **each** (it will not divide the 1 abLoc in between the 2).

The bot will still pull a fee of 0.1 abLoc extra from your balance.

This can be used to tip - so far - an unlimited amount of people, given that you have enough balance.  
The bot will PM you after it has sent the payments to everyone, letting you know the TX Hash, your updated balance, and how many people it sent it to, along with the number of -

- successful payments (the recipient had registered their wallet and the payment was successfully sent)  
- unsuccessful payments (the recipient had not registered their wallet and/or the payment was not successfully sent)

If you tip multiple people, some who have registered their wallets and some who haven't, the bot will react with ![99](images/trtlbot-plus-plus/almost100.png) and :sos: for both(only once).  
However, it will not let you know whose wallet has not been registered, simply the amount of people it did send it to (so you can deduce the number of people it was not able to send to by subtracting the number of successful payments from the number of people you tipped).

*Sadly, trying to tip "Roles" (like `@dev-turtle`, `@everyone`, `@here` etc) and expecting the bot to automatically tip everyone with that said role won't work, as it has not been programmed to do so* :(

### Where Do These Tips Go?

When you tip someone, the desired amount plus 0.1 abLoc is pulled from your tipjar wallet balance and sent to the recipient's registered wallet (if he has not registered a wallet, he cannot receive tips).

When you get tipped, the sender sends the desired amount plus 0.1 abLoc, pulled from his tipjar wallet balance, directly to your registered wallet (if you haven't registered a wallet, you can't receive tips).  
It also reacts to the message on which the person was tipped (`.tip 1 @RockSteady#7588`) with ![moneywings](images/trtlbot-plus-plus/rsz_money_with_wings.png).

It *does not* send the abLoc to your tipjar balance. It sends it *directly* to your **wallet**.  

However, you can redirect tips that you receive from others with `.redirecttips` to have tips go directly to your tip balance (you still have to have registered a wallet however)

- If you try to tip someone who isn't registered, the bot will react with :sos: and PM them with instructions on how to register their wallet and tip.

## Security of trtlbot++'s tipjar (wallet)

trtlbot++ was created by [@krruzic](https://github.com/krruzic)(@madk#1044  in the chat) and then rewritten by [@BrandonT42](https://github.com/BrandonT42)(@Canti#6146), but hosted by krruzic still. When he was asked about the security of trtlbot++'s wallet, he said-

"*the wallet is pretty secure. All ports are closed except 80, whatever minecraft is and my SSH port. The SSH has no root login and only two valid keys. ~~One of the keys is for an account that has no permissions to go anywhere but one folder (I may revoke this key)~~ *[This key has since been revoked]*. There are other security features but I don't want to reveal any possible attack surfaces by accident.*"

and follows up with-

"*And if the wallet gets hacked I will refund people's coins.*"

and ends it with-

"*I'm not gonna up and run with the tipjar like the doge tipbot guy either* :)"

So rest assured, trtlbot++'s wallet is extremely secure, and in the rare occasion that anything *does* happen, you can relax knowing that you'll get it back ;)
