# BLOC Ressources & API

[BLOC](https://bloc.money) believes that the cryptocurrency era will require a broader development community than just a few leading crypto platforms. For this reason, **BLOC** is providing an open platform that enables companies to build their own products using **BLOC API**. It is very easy to integrate **BLOC** payment into your website/ecommerce/phisical store/application.

**BLOC** has unfolded and advanced a set of key methods to portray universal and integrated access to act as an alternative or replace the current banking system in regards to the expensive and restricted POS contactless terminals.

We also have some specific language bindings to make integration easier. You can find more details on the [Ressources page](../API/Resources.md).
