# **TRAAKX the world 1st Proof Of Training**

Almost 2 years of hard work to be able to bring this project to life. We are pleased to introduce today a beta version of [TRAAKX website](http://traakx.com/traakx/). The world most advanced sport community combined with artificial intelligence. Extract impressive data from any [GoPro footage](https://gopro.com) footage to compare yourself with other riders from the same sport and increase your level.

Later we are going to release a [TRAAKX custom hardware](TRAAKX-hardware.md) to get more precise data than the GoPro.

How height did you go ? How fast ? Watch out impressive runs with synchronised data. There is no lie anymore. A new proof of training is born. Welcome to a new era for athletes with endless possibilities.

Blockchain offers an unprecedented level of transparency for transactions: you don’t need to rely on a middleman to make sure that a certain transaction took place and was processed correctly. This allows creating a decentralized system that makes crowdfunding easier. So much so that sports players, especially young athletes, will be able to boost their careers by getting public support — and their growing professionalism will in turn bring in more and more money.

TRAAKX the first project to tokenize athletes, aims to do exactly that: revolutionize the sport talent management system by using custom developed hardware to track athletes performances and blockchain technology to decentralize it and facilitate support for athletes, then share the value with the community.

## **What is TRAAKX ?**

TRAAKX was created by the FuriousTeam and is part of the BLOC ecosystem. We started this project long time ago but it tooks us so much work, money and ennergy including many failure, a very long path to be able to write this post today.

Every service or products to buy/sell from the TRAAKX community will be available in the cryptocurrency BLOC only.

TRAAKX is the first social network dedicated to athletes and sports men. Share your training session on TRAAKX, follow the pros and their advices, improve your skills, get instant access to all your runs, a worldwide rank and many more in our application that you will be able to download for free on the App Store and Google Play Store.

## **TRAAKX Custom Hardware**

Having so much data from a GoPro is cool but the sensors used on the GoPro are not accurate enough to be able to analize a complete run, specially if you are using it on the water. The GPS takes a lot of time to calibrate and can sometime gives bad data until it found the correct calibration.

Traakx is a device which is able to record movement and position in multiple axes. All this is done using a micro controller which gathers data from the sensors and stores it on a micro SD card in order to communicate over wifi and send the data for analysis procedures to the TRAAKX server and then receive the extracted data and display them in a graphical user interface.

## **How does it look in real life ?**

We have tested TRAAKX on Franky Zapata. You may have seen him already with multi millions views on Youtube riding his Flyboard Air. Franky is a French entrepreneur and it was a great experience to test TRAAKX during the last RedBull Air Race in Cannes. Check out the video:

You can see the impressive run data [on the TRAAKX website](http://traakx.com/traakx/run/details?id=237). Reaching 158 km/h + on a flying jetpack ! **The future is NOW**.

## **How does it work ?**

It’s easy. It works with a GoPro. All you need to do is record yourself while you are doing your sport. Jump as high as you can, run or ride as fast as you can.
**To make it short: Just send it ! We call this a run.**

Once you have recorded your run you can use the [TRAAKX website](http://traakx.com/traakx/) or the TRAAKX app for iPhone (curently only available in BETA) to upload your run to generate impressive data you never seen before, share it with the community and compare yourself with other athletes.

## **What kind of data it is ?**

We are using the GoPro sensors such as the GPS, accelerometer.. and a private algorithm to convert this raw data and synchronise them together on a nice and easy to use interface showing charts such as distance, altitude, Gforce, GPS track, Roll, Pitch and much more details.

## **A new Proof Of Training is born**

Now it’s easy to track the progress of an athlete, make sure he’s training properly and regulary. Just watch the video embedded with the TRAAKX datas and check out the training session. [TRAAKX website](http://traakx.com/traakx/).

## **Athletes Will Be Viewed As Assets**

Much like companies that trade on a stock market, every athlete will have a market price in BLOC following his market dominance. The price of a share will increase as the athlete makes progress.

There will be lots of factors influencing the token price: a lucrative deal with a big brand will cause it to skyrocket, while a massive loss to a weaker opponent will make his market dominance slump. In addition to success in sports, there will be other ways for athletes to enhance their value, including a strong social media presence, charitable initiatives, sponsorship contracts, and licensing their name to a brand.

For athletes to be listed on the TRAAKX market: it can be done automatically at some stage of career development (reaching a certain level by uploading TRAAKX run), or voluntarily when an athlete decides to get listed.

Also, there is bound to be speculation, long-term and short-term investments, data mining and complex models to determine profitable strategies, and other features of the stock market.

When you buy a BLOC coin, you help to support an athlete; BLOC coin can then be redeemed to get a share of their income, endorsements at a significant discount, training time, sponsoring, and other goodies. This new approach has the potential to change the whole industry in just a decade.

## **Tokenization Will Fuel Interest In The Greater Domain Of Sports**

As bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are becoming revolutionary, individuals who previously had no particular interest in blockchain are now always kept up to date with the development of these advanced technologies.

As more individuals will be willing to invest in sports cryptocurrency, the market will grow, and a similar situation as the bitcoin will happen to the domain of sports. Therefore, the growing audience across a global scale will create a boost in the sports market.

## **Future of TRAAKX**

Once the iPhone app will be available on the app store it will be already a huge progress. Then we will have to work on implementing the new features of TRAAKX to include the blockchain layer part. In the same time we need to finish the hardware. This is still a long time process but we are on the right path.

Are you ready for the challenge ? Dream big. Ride bigger with TRAAKX and BLOC.

## **Sales**

We are already dealing with multiple retail sport brands to resell the TRAAKX device all over the world. We are planning to sell about 10000 to 50000 TRAAKX devices for the 1st year of release following upcoming contracts.

## **Release date**

We plan to release the 1st version of the TRAAKX APP before the end of this year. The hardware is still under development at this stage.

## **Decentralised Fuel to Power the Engine**

All the TRAAKX products and services will be invoiced in the currency [BLOC](https://bloc.money).
