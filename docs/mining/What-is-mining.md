# **What is mining ?**

Cryptocurrency mining includes two functions, namely: adding transactions to the blockchain (securing and verifying) and also releasing new currency. Mining needs a device such as a computer or mobile device and a special program, which helps miners compete with their peers in solving complicated mathematical problems.

Mining is the process of adding transaction records to cryptocurency public ledger of past transactions. This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. Mining is so called because it resembles the mining of other commodities: it requires exertion and it slowly makes new currency available at a rate that resembles the rate at which commodities like gold are mined from the ground.

## **Egalitarian Proof of Work**

[BLOC](https://bloc.money) has an amazing feature that balance the low end hardware, middle and high end hardware. That means that even if you use a smartphone or a normal computer or any other low end hardware, you will be able to mine **BLOC** with the same probabilty of coin reward.

On top of that we have updated the core of **BLOC** to be ASIC resistant using the latest Cryptonight haven algorythm which is a variant of Monero. Everyone can mine BLOC with a true egalitarian proof of work (POW) and fair money distribution.
